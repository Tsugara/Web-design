         <h1> About JavaScript</h1>
      </div>
      <div id="content">
         <p><strong> JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language.</strong> It has been standardized in the ECMAScript 
		 language specification. Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the three essential technologies of World Wide Web content production; the majority 
		 of websites employ it and it is supported by all modern web browsers without plug-ins.[6] JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class functions, 
		 making it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented,[8] imperative, and functional programming styles. It has an API for working with 
		 text, arrays, dates and regular expressions, but does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage or graphics facilities, relying for these upon 
		 the host environment in which it is embedded.
         <h2>Use in web pages</h2>
         <p>The most common use of JavaScript is to add client-side behavior to HTML pages, a.k.a. Dynamic HTML (DHTML). Scripts are embedded in or included 
		 from HTML pages and interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) of the page.Because JavaScript code can run locally in a user's browser (rather than
		 on a remote server), the browser can respond to user actions quickly, making an application more responsive. Furthermore, JavaScript code can detect 
		 user actions that HTML alone cannot, such as individual keystrokes. Applications such as Gmail take advantage of this: much of the user-interface 
		 logic is written in JavaScript, and JavaScript dispatches requests for information (such as the content of an e-mail message) to the server. 
		 The wider trend of Ajax programming similarly exploits this strength. Some simple examples of this usage are:
         <ul>
            <li>Loading new page content or submitting data to the server via AJAX without reloading the page (for example, a social network might allow the 
			user to post status updates without leaving the page);</li>
            <li>Animation of page elements, fading them in and out, resizing them, moving them, etc;</li>
            <li>Interactive content, for example games, and playing audio and video;</li>
            <li>Validating input values of a Web form to make sure that they are acceptable before being submitted to the server.</li>
            <li>Transmitting information about the user's reading habits and browsing activities to various websites. Web pages frequently do this for web 
			analytics, ad tracking, personalization or other purposes.</li>
         </ul>
         </p>
