            <p><strong><em> HyperText Markup Language</em> commonly referred to as <em> HTML</em>  is the standard markup language used to create web pages.</strong>
			Web browsers can read HTML files and render them into visible or audible web pages. HTML describes the structure of a website semantically along 
			with cues for presentation, making it a markup language, rather than a programming language.HTML elements form the building blocks of all websites. 
			HTML allows images and objects to be embedded and can be used to create interactive forms. It provides a means to create structured documents by 
			denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
            </p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, then a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share 
			documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and 
			server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, 
			but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes from 1990 he listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is 
			used" and put an encyclopedia first.HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images and other material into 
			visual or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be 
			altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are found in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 
			Techniques for using SGML, which in turn covers the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed 
			in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system: these formatting commands were derived from the commands used 
			by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with 
			attributes) rather than merely print effects, with also the separation of structure and markup; HTML has been progressively moved in this direction
			with CSS
