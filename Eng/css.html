            <p><strong> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong> — is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a 
			markup language. Although most often used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can
			be applied to any XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media. Along with HTML and 
			JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and 
			user interfaces for many mobile applications
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>CSS was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994.[14] At the time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. Several other style
			sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time, and discussions on public mailing lists and inside W3C resulted in the first W3C 
			CSS Recommendation (CSS1)[16] being released in 1996. In particular, Bert Bos' proposal was influential; he became co-author of CSS1 and is 
			regarded as co-creator of CSS</p>
            <h3>Use</h3>
            <p>Before CSS, nearly all of the presentational attributes of HTML documents were contained within the HTML markup; all font colors, background 
			styles, element alignments, borders and sizes had to be explicitly described, often repeatedly, within the HTML. CSS allows authors to move much of 
			that information to another file, the style sheet, resulting in considerably simpler HTML.<br>Before CSS, document authors who wanted to assign such 
			typographic characteristics to, say, all h2 headings had to repeat HTML presentational markup for each occurrence of that heading type. This made 
			documents more complex, larger, and more error-prone and difficult to maintain. CSS allows the separation of presentation from structure. CSS can 
			define color, font, text alignment, size, borders, spacing, layout and many other typographic characteristics, and can do so independently for 
			on-screen and printed views. CSS also defines non-visual styles such as the speed and emphasis with which text is read out by aural text readers. 
			The W3C has now deprecated the use of all presentational HTML markup
